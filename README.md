## Terminal  
```
sudo apt-get install python-picamera
nano cameraexample.py
python cameraexample.py
```
  
## What it does?
1. It first installs python-picamera so we can use the supersimple camera module that we get for Raspberry Pi.   
2. Then we write the python code in nano. **see cameraexample.py**, That's the code I wrote.  
3. Finally we execute the code with python cameraexample.py and the camera module clicks a photo as saves it as "example.jpg".
